    "We are tasked to best estimates prices for houses being built by Capital Fortune real-estate company, who are building houses in Brooklyn, NY. We extracted data from the nyc_housing data from zillow. We need to build a predict model which can best estimate prices for the houses given the brooklyn market. \n",
    "\n",
    "We started by inspecting our original dataframe which had over 75k rows and 1507 columns, we began to start cleaning our data as a lot of our columns which were not relevant or repeated information of other columns. We needed to isolate the dataframe for our target location which is Brooklyn so we filtered our nyc dataframe to all address which resided in Brooklyn. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next step was to clean up some of the data types for our columns, unfortunately there were a lot of missing data to counter-act we either dropped those columns or imputed data to some important columns. For instance we change our column type of Has_Basement to True or False to simplify this feature. our column names were quite un-intuitive from the original datafile so we relabeled a lot of them for more readable names.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We noticed there were a lot fo houses which were sold for prices far below their market value for instance a million dollar house was sold for 5000, these are cases where family members sell their property to other family and friends to change ownership and etc. So we excluded these houses, the opposite was also the case there were few observations where their price was 100 million and above we realized a lot of the hometype labeled vacant land were lots for large office space and warehouses behind sold, as these properties does not relate to houses being built by Capital Fortune we ommited these as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "We wanted to do an analysis on neighborhoods in brooklyn and how their prices differ so we utilized a geolocator to reverse geocode neighborhoods using latitudes and longitudes which was in our dataframe. One issue was a lot of neighborhood in the Kings County distinct was not coming up in our API so we left them as Kings County thus why they have the largest number of rows. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reverse geolocation was a interesting idea but the time it takes to process is unbearable, as we are capped to one requests per second with our API, it took hours to finish our neighborhood look up. But once we gathered all the neighborhoods via its latitude and longitude we were able to see how the average price of their houses were distributed for each neighborhood. We also peeked into some neighborhood summary\n",
    "\n",
    "While this was a cleaning of the data I believe we better fine tune our data and perphaps impute more missing data based on better classification rather than just using the average. "
