Project 
==============================

## What is the goal?
New York City(NYC) is one of the largest financial central hub on Earth, it has
the 44th largest population of all cities in the world which makes it a prime area
for growing real-estate investments. The Housing Market has been booming
since the great recession of 2008, as prices keep skyrocketing our client Capital
Fortune who are a mid-west real-estate investment trust are seeking an opportu-
nity to capitalize on this growth. They have multiple properties set to be built
in the 5 boroughs of New York City by 2025. They are seeking our help with
identifying key insights and intrinsic value behind the homes in the 5 boroughs.

## The Client
Capital Fortune is naive to the local market conditions of New York City and are concerned on the pricing of their homes on release to the market, they are afraid if they have a steep asking price they will be left waiting and buyers will flock to older and more competitive homes and lose time and money on their investment. 
They also do not want to price too low as this will result in not maximizing net-profits. They are also interested in different home structures and which yield the greatest net-profits
 
## The Data set

There are many historical data sets available on New York City housing prices but I wanted to make use of recent and real home prices given in listing websites. 
Zillow is a real estate listing platform for buyers and sellers to do business, they utilize their Zestimates prediction to garner new users to estimate their own home values. 
While I will not be working with their Zestimates prediction feature I will be using their New York City Housing data set from 2019. The data set contains 75630 observations and 1507 columns.
## My job?

As a native New York resident I am decently knowledgeable on our local housing
markets but I need to do some analysis before jumping to obvious conclusions. I
am tasked to find the average prices for homes in each borough, and key insights
to which residential units yield the highest net-profits.

## The Results
All results and findings are in the NYC_Housing_report file, the link is provided on top. 
TLDR: Home prices are heavily reliant on location, with Manhattan topping all other boroughs. 
Multi-family homes and condo's have the highest net-profits
